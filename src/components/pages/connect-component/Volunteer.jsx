          <h1>Volunteer Opportunities</h1>
          <p>Are you someone who works in a STEM field looking to excite and inspire girls? Did you have a mentor who encouraged you to pursue your science or engineering interests? Be that person for young girls and their families by volunteering as a mentor with us! Or are you not in a STEM field but looking for an opportunity to impact girls and their families through fun hands-on science and engineering activities?

            Consider volunteering at one of our workshops! Volunteers keep our workshops running smoothly by helping lead activities, welcoming girls at registration, and encouraging them during the projects. Whatever your interest or time commitment is, we have a role for you! Both male and female volunteers are welcome.

            If you are not from Oregon or Washington, please check back for new volunteer opportunities as STEM Like a Girl grows and expands our program to new geographical locations. If you are interested in bringing STEM Like a Girl to your community, please check out our Start a STEM Like a Girl Site information page to learn more about what is involved.  </p>
