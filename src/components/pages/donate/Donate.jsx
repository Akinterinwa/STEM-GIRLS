                            <p>Weâ€™re well into the 21st century, but the gender gap in the tech industry remains:</p>

                                <li>*Only 5% of leadership positions in tech are held by women.</li>
                                <li>*20% of women over the age of 35 are still in junior positions.</li>
                                <li>*47% is the turnover rate for women (compared to 17% for men).</li>
                                <li>*Women experience a 3% pay gap across the board, while LGBTQ experience an 8% pay gap, and for black women this goes up to 11%.</li>
