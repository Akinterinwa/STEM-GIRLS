      <p>There are three key factors that help promote interest and excitement around STEM activities in young girls.  Our affordable, research-based program combines these three elements to begin cultivating a positive STEM identity for girls.</p>
      <div className="image-within-text">
        <h3>EARLY EXPOSURE</h3>
        <p> <img  className='image-size' src={IntroImg} alt="intro" style={{ float: 'right', marginLeft: '10px'}}  /> Girls can’t become excited about something if they aren’t exposed to it!  Although there has been significant advancement in
          education and promotion of STEM activities for girls, women still hold only 24% of STEM jobs in the U.S. 1  Studies show that 
          girls enjoy STEM activities but about 4 in 10 girls say they don’t get enough practical experience.2  Many existing programs focus on
           high school age girls when interest in these fields has already declined.   Our program focuses on 3rd-5th grade girls and lets them work <img className='image-size' src={IntroImg} alt="intro" style={{ float: 'left', marginRight: '10px' }}  />
           through fun, hands-on science and engineering challenges that will excite and expose them to the fields of STEM.  Our goal is to introduce girls to STEM activities and
            give families the tools to continue to pursue further opportunities to develop a STEM identity for your daughters.</p>
