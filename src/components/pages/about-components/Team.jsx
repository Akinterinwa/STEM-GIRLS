            <p><img src={FounderImg} alt="founder" className='founder-img' /> While leading a hands-on engineering project in her son’s elementary school, Sarah noticed less girls raising their hands or
              jumping into the activities than the boys.  She was surprised to see a gender gap at such a young age and decided she needed to
              do something to change this!  Sarah founded STEM Like a Girl in 2017 with the goal to introduce young girls to exciting, fun, and
              rewarding activities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).  An East Coast native, Sarah has an undergraduate degree
              in chemical engineering from Bucknell University and a masters in biomedical engineering from Boston University.  She worked as a Research
              and Development Engineer in the biotech field before taking on her biggest experiment in 2011, becoming a mom!  She quickly learned there is
              no scientific method or protocol for raising two energetic boys!  While not currently using her engineering expertise in a traditional sense,
              Sarah is passionate about educating youth, specifically girls, and their families in STEM activities and hopes to inspire the next generation of
              scientists and engineers.  She is also the author of the book STEM Like a Girl: Empowering Knowledge and Confidence to Lead, Innovate, and Create that
              profiles 35 girls expressing their love of all things STEM as well as providing 15 experiments girls can do at home. Sarah lives in Portland, OR with her
              husband and two young boys and loves being outside enjoying the beautiful Pacific Northwest.</p>

              her undergraduate and masters in Civil Engineering from Washington State University. Go Cougs! During her
              career, she has had the privilege of working on some awesome projects like the new Panama Canal and the longest
              cable ferry in the world! Courtney also worked in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to protect the city from future
              hurricanes. When she is not designing steel and concrete structures at work, she enjoys visiting classrooms, building popsicle
              stick bridges and gummy bear domes.  Courtney is excited to be a part of the STEM Like a Girl to inspire the next generation of
